# Disconnected Upgrade

## Action Required
* Local registry must be [seeded](../../container-registry.md) with the images required for the upgrade.
* Local package repository must contain the required [packages](../../packages.md) for the upgrade.

## Summary
Starting with v1.6.0, KET no longer relies on the RPM or DEB packages maintained
by the Kismatic team. Instead, KET installs the packages that are maintained by 
the community. This has an impact on registry seeding, given that KET no longer
has access to the `kismatic-offline` package which contained all the container 
images required for an installation or upgrade. Moving forward, you are required
to seed the image registry before the upgrade.

## Scenarios

### Existing cluster with user-managed local registry
In this scenario, your local registry is already set in the KET plan file, and
KET has seeded your registry in the past during the installation or upgrade process.

Moving forward, you are required to seed your local registry before performing
an upgrade. KET v1.6.0 introduced a new command, `seed-registry`, that will
assist you in this task. For more information, see the 
[container registry](../../container-registry.md) documentation and the
[disconnected installation](../../disconnected_install.md) documentation.

### Existing cluster with registry stood up by KET
In this scenario, your local registry was stood up by KET and the docker registry
related fields (`docker_registry.address` and `docker_registry.port`) are not 
set in the plan file.

Moving forward, you must seed the registry before performing an upgrade.
Furthermore, you must set the docker registry fields in the plan file to the 
appropriate values.

Given that the registry deployed by KET is not recommended for production
deployments, we recommend you use your own registry. If you want to move away
from the KET-deployed registry, you can set the plan file fields to point to
the new registry before the upgrade. KET will update all the manifests and 
the images will be pulled from your local registry, instead of the one deployed 
by KET.

If you want to continue using the registry that was deployed by KET, you must
set the plan file fields to the following values:
* `docker_registry.server`: The hostname or IP of the first master node and port 8443 (This is the port that KET used when deploying the registry during the (installation of your cluster). This
is where KET deployed the registry during the installation of your cluster.
* `docker_registry.CA`: Absolute path to the certificate authority located in
`generated/keys/ca.pem`

When using the `seed-registry` command to seed the registry deployed by KET, you
must configure docker on the node where you are running the command to trust the
certificate authority generated by KET. The way to configure this in docker 
depends on the operating system. If you are seeding the registry from a Linux 
machine, you must copy the `generated/keys/ca.pem` certificate to 
`/etc/docker/certs.d/${docker_registry.server}/ca.crt`. For example, if
the `docker_registry.server` field is set to `registry.example.com:8443`, you would 
copy the CA to `/etc/docker/certs.d/registry.example.com:8443/ca.crt`. See the
[official docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#use-self-signed-certificates)
for more information about using a registry with a self-signed certificate.
